title: "Study groups - Register Space"
date: "2024-03-14"
description: "As several students are facing challenges in initiating data management tasks, and various statistical programs are being utilized, we have decided to establish a study group community. We will discuss the framework for this during an upcoming Register Space meeting.
For now, we have set up a Google Docs document where we encourage all those working with data within "Register Space" to sign up. The document is private and requires my approval for access. I aim to approve requests within approximately 24 hours."
